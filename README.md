Video to frame to MEI 
You can convert video to frames then to motion energy images.

Keypoints

1- Open "1.png": your video file, you want to convert it into frames, and "video__to___frames.m" file should be in the same folder as illustrated in "1.png" 

2- Open "2.png": you will see the frames are taken from the video file, the frames and your video file are in the same file.

3. Open a new file named "All_frames_1" and copy all the frames from your video files directory, then paste them into the "All_frames_1" file.

4- Open "3.png": you will see where your files directory should be.

5. Open "4.png": Finally, you can see where your MEI image file is located.

We use this MEI method in our paper, and we submit it. If Ä±t's accepted, I will share the paper's information in this repository. 
Please verify this information in the future.
